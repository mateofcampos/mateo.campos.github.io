  <h3>Self-Portrait</h3>
      <p>Installing ToonBoom Harmony, our first assignment was to make a self-portrait and get the hang of using this software!</p>

  <h3>Computer Bug</h3>
      <p>Now that I got accustomed to using ToonBoom, it was time for my first animation assignment! I was tasked with drawing a bug, making it move from one side to the other, using 72 frames.</p>

  <h3>Sitting Down</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, I was tasked with acting out and drawing an animation of myself sitting down. I needed to do a drawing of myself standing, looking at where I'm going to sit, a sit down in-between pose, sitting pose, and a settled pose.</p>

  <h3>Project 1: Traditional Animation</h3>
      <p>For the first project, I was tasked with using traditional frame-by-frame techniques to animate a character conveying an emotion. I made my character actively walk from one side of the screen to the other showing off what they are feeling.</p>

  <h3>Character Wave</h3>
      <p>For this assignment, we started moving into Arm Waving techniques with the use of parenting and pivoting points, and animating attribute editor key frames.</p>

  <h3>Tractor vs. Village</h3>
      <p>This assignment concentrated on key-frame animation. I was given a tractor and tasked with cutting it up into three parts: the body, arm, and base. Rigging the truck together, I made the truck approach the village and dig up a house.</p>

  <h3>Fish Bowl</h3>
      <p>In this assignment I drew a fish character, with fins and the tail on a seperate layer. Similar to the bug assignment where I drew it traveling from one side of the screen to the other, this time however I drew it to be rigged and used key-framing. I animated a fish moving in a water tank with characters from the Animal Crossing series watching from afar.</p>

  <h3>Project 2: Puppet Animation</h3>
      <p>For the second project, learning from previous assingments, I took my character and applied a scene where it was a "puppet". I rigged and added a background to show my character in an airport, moving and holding a suitcase waving to someone off-screen.</p>
