	<h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>For the longest time, I've had a passion for being an artist and animating! I want to be someone who has mastered drawing and digital artwork, who can amaze people with the kinds of things I could create on paper or from a tablet. After practicing on paper for the longest time, I recently moved onto creating digital artwork with the use of my Huion tablet and drawing softwares.
<br>
<br>
As someone who wants to design and create ideas to life, this is where I took an interest as well in UX/UI Design. I've been really passionate about creating my own menu design and layouts, and want to make my own products! 
<br>
<br>
During my time at Cañada College and San Jose State University, I’ve been working on honing my drawing and design skills, taking drawing courses, working with Photoshop, and Adobe XD. Currently, I am creating case studies and mockups with Figma, where I can show my design process ranging from the conceptual idea with the use of mockups and wireframes to the final products.
<br>
<br>
I've earned a Bachelors of Fine Arts at San Jose State University for Digital Art & Media, and a Google UX Design Certificate. I want to hone my skills when it comes to making designs and I want people to notice me for how creative and well crafted my style is. I want my name to mean something in the future and hopefully have many people appreciate the kinds of things I create throughout my journey as an artist and designer.
